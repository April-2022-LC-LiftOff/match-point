      "description": "<p>Find adventure in this marvelous asymmetric game. Root provides limitless replay value as you and your friends explore the unique factions all wanting to rule a fantastic forest kingdom. Play as the Marquise de Cat and dominate the woods, extracting its riches and policing its inhabitants, as the Woodland Alliance, gathering supporters and coordinate revolts against the ruling regime, the Eyrie Dynasties, regaining control of the woods while keeping your squabbling court at bay, or as the Vagabond, seeking fame and fortune as you forge alliances and rivalries with the other players. Each faction has its own play style and paths to victory, providing an immersive game experience you will want to play again and again.</p>",
      "commentary": "<p>During a car ride, designer Cole and his wife were listening to an audio book of T. H. White's <strong>The Once and Future King</strong>. When the Monarch of Moat delivered the following line to Arthur, it spawned a series of ideas creating the framework for Root, a game of Might and Right: &quot;...There is only power. Power is of the individual mind, but the mind's power is not enough. Power of the body decides everything in the end, and only Might is Right.&quot;</p>",
      "faq": "<p><strong>Who goes first?</strong></p>\n<p>According to the official rules, your group determines the starting player and seating order randomly (Rule 5.1.1). After the starting player finishes their turn, the next clockwise player begins their turn (Rule 1.5). A common house (unofficial) rule among fans is to have the Marquise (Cat) faction start the game especially at 4 or more player counts.</p>\n<p><strong>Is this a good 2-player game?</strong></p>\n<p>While some may still enjoy the 2-player gameplay (and I am one of them), it's not the ideal player count due to limited number of viable faction combinations. Every faction has an assigned \"Reach Value\" that represents the amount of influence they can have over the board state, and Leder Games recommends that the total Reach Value should equal or exceed the minimum indicated for the player count (see table below). For example, for 2-player gameplay using the base game, the only viable factions are Marquise and Eyrie.</p>\n<p><img class=\"w-50\" src=\"https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/700x700/games/userfiles/1613783703105-root%20faction%20reach%20values.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>If you want to have a fuller experience at a 2-player count, here are some options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/AMEwdJGV5c/root-the-clockwork-expansion\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: 'AMEwdJGV5c', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Root: The Clockwork Expansion</a> - Adds simulated opponent(s).

      "description": "<p><em>Scythe</em> gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player's individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &quot;Encounter&quot; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.<br /><br /><em>Scythe</em> uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.<br /><br />Every part of <em>Scythe</em> has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.</p>",

      "description_preview": "  Scythe  gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player's individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are \"Encounter\" cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.   Scythe  uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.  Every part of  Scythe  has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times. "

      "description": "<p><em><strong>Wingspan</strong></em> is a competitive, medium-weight, card-driven, engine-building board game from Stonemaier Games.</p>\r\n<p>You are bird enthusiasts—researchers, bird watchers, ornithologists, and collectors—seeking to discover and attract the best birds to your aviary. Each bird extends a chain of powerful combinations in one of your habitats (actions). These habitats focus on several key aspects of growth:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Gain food tokens via custom dice in a birdfeeder dice tower</li>\r\n<li>Lay eggs using egg miniatures in a variety of colors</li>\r\n<li>Draw from hundreds of unique bird cards and play them</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The winner is the player with the most points after 4 rounds.</p>",
      "commentary": "<p>Wingspan's artists, Ana and Natalia, have been friends since high school in Colombia. After Natalia moved to the U.S., she ran into <a href=\"/designer/MANNUPclkd/alan-stone\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Stone</a> through their kids' school, which led to her getting connected with <a href=\"/designer/QIz5pAPzFk/jamey-stegmaier\" target=\"_blank\">Jamey Stegmaier</a> of <a href=\"/publisher/njVFVNfJc7/stonemaier-games\" target=\"_blank\">Stonemaier Games</a>. Check out this interview <a href=\"/forum/XTO9WbDBqe/how-the-best-board-game-of-2019-wingspan-reunited-two-high-school-friends-interview\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></p>\r\n<p>In an interview, designer <a href=\"/designer/UBhK4cSEV6/elizabeth-hargrave\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Hargrave</a> commented that she felt &quot;... there were too many games about castles and space, and not enough games about things I'm interested in. So I decided to make a game about something I cared about.&quot;</p>",
      "faq": "<p><strong>Is it hard to learn?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The rulebook is well-organized and easy to follow. You can learn how to play the game after reading through 10 pages of rules accompanied by plenty of visual cues and breathing space between text. Alternatively, you can use the Quick-Reference Guide (page 2 of the Appendix) if you want to learn the game in real-time.</p>\r\n<p>Veteran gamers will find it relatively easy to learn and teach, while new gamers may feel that it's more complex than what they're used to. When it comes to learning the actual strategy, the game will likely \"click\" for the majority of the players by the time your group finishes the 1st Round (there are 4 Rounds total).</p>\r\n<p>Due to the game's simple turn structure and types of actions available, you'll quickly pick up on how the game works by watching your friends play. So while you may not be playing optimally or finding the best combos to pull off, you'll likely feel comfortable by the start of Round 2.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For those who've played Stonemaier Games' <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/7NYbgH2Z2I/viticulture-essential-edition\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: '7NYbgH2Z2I', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Viticulture: Essential Edition</a>, Wingspan is less complex than Viticulture in terms of strategy elements and has fewer rules to memorize. If you have detailed questions about the game, you'll likely find an answer within this <a href=\"https://stonemaiergames.com/games/wingspan/rules/\">comprehensive FAQ</a> put together by Stonemaier Games.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is it good for 2 players?</strong></p>\r\n<p>2-player gameplay won't trigger pink bird powers as frequently, which are activated once per turn if a criteria is met during an opponent's turn (e.g. get \"X\" benefit when another player does \"Y\" action). There will also be less competition for valuable birds cards or for the food dice from the birdfeeder.</p>\r\n<p>Wingspan is a relatively low interaction game. This means that the gameplay won't feel much different at low or high player counts and makes for an easily scalable game. So if you love Wingspan at high player counts, you'll love it at 2-player count as well. On the other hand, if you're someone who prefers highly interactive games where your actions directly impact another player's strategies, you should try it out before making the purchase.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is there a hand limit?</strong></p>\r\n<p>There is no limit to the number of bird cards you can have in your hand.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can you play alone?</strong></p>\r\n<p>As with most Stonemaier Games titles, Wingspan comes with a separate set of rules for the Automa, an AI opponent that simulates playing against a human opponent. This game was rated #13 on \"2020 People's Choice Top 200 Solo Games.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>Who goes first?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The first player is randomnly selected by your group. That player gets the first-player token and will kick off the game.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How do you win?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The player with the most points wins. Tally up points for the following and determine the winner:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Points based on bird cards played on your tableau</li>\r\n<li>Points for bonus card(s) accomplished</li>\r\n<li>Points for end-of-round goals</li>\r\n<li>1 point for each:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Egg on a bird card</li>\r\n<li>Food token cached on a bird card</li>\r\n<li>Card tucked under a bird card</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In case of a tie, number of unused food tokens serve as tiebreaker. If still tied, they share the victory.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What's inside the box?</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>170 unique bird cards (57x87mm)</li>\r\n<li>26 bonus cards (57x87mm)</li>\r\n<li>16 Automa cards (57x87mm)</li>\r\n<li>103 food tokens</li>\r\n<li>75 egg miniatures</li>\r\n<li>5 custom wooden dice</li>\r\n<li>5 player mats</li>\r\n<li>1 birdfeeder dice tower</li>\r\n<li>2-piece Game Trayz custom tray</li>\r\n<li>1 goal mat</li>\r\n<li>8 goal tiles</li>\r\n<li>1 first-player token</li>\r\n<li>40 action cubes (8 per player)</li>\r\n<li>1 scorepad (50 sheets; 1 sheet used for all players each game)</li>\r\n<li>3 rulebooks</li>\r\n</ul>",

      "description": "<p><strong>Gloomhaven</strong> is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world.<br /><br />Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.<br /><br />This is a legacy game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.</p>",

      "description_preview": "  Gloomhaven  is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world.  Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.  This is a legacy game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.

      "description": "<p>In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete in doing the best work, with victory points awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar systems and other commendable achievements. The players acquire unique project cards, which represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. You compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles and greenery tiles. When the terraforming process is complete, the player corporation with the most victory points wins.</p>",
      "commentary": "<p>FryxGames, the makers of Terraforming Mars, is a family business run by 5 brothers out of a family of 10 brothers, 6 sisters, and 2 parents. Even outside of the 5 brothers, most of the family is involved in the creation process one way or the other.</p>",

      "description_preview": " In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete in doing the best work, with victory points awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar systems and other commendable achievements. The players acquire unique project cards, which represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. You compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles and greenery tiles. When the terraforming process is complete, the player corporation with the most victory points wins. "

      "description": "<p>After five years of Pandemic, hundreds of thousands of players have contracted the virus! To celebrate this milestone, Pandemic has been completely re-designed. With new artwork by Chris Quilliams (Clash of Cultures, Merchants &amp; Marauders), Pandemic will now have a more modern look, inside and outside the box. With two new characters (the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist) face the game in ways you never thought possible as brand-new, virulent challenges await you!</p>\r\n<p>In <em><strong>Pandemic</strong></em>, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.</p>\r\n<p>The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are <em>Epidemic!</em> cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &quot;normal&quot; spread of the infections.</p>\r\n<p>Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five—but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!</p>\r\n<p>The 2013 edition of <em>Pandemic</em> includes two new characters—the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist—not available in earlier editions of the game.</p>\r\n<h4>Artists:</h4>\r\n<p>Joshua Cappel (graphics and illustration)</p>\r\n<p>Régis Moulun (cover painting)</p>\r\n<p>Chris Quilliams (2013 edition)<br /><br /><br /></p>",

      "description_preview": " After five years of Pandemic, hundreds of thousands of players have contracted the virus! To celebrate this milestone, Pandemic has been completely re-designed. With new artwork by Chris Quilliams (Clash of Cultures, Merchants & Marauders), Pandemic will now have a more modern look, inside and outside the box. With two new characters (the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist) face the game in ways you never thought possible as brand-new, virulent challenges await you! \r\n In   Pandemic  , several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand. \r\n The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are  Epidemic!  cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the \"normal\" spread of the infections. \r\n Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five—but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win! \r\n The 2013 edition of  Pandemic  includes two new characters—the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist—not available in earlier editions of the game. \r\n Artists: \r\n Joshua Cappel (graphics and illustration) \r\n Régis Moulun (cover painting) \r\n Chris Quilliams (2013 edition)    "

      "description": "<p>Powerful Spirits have existed on this isolated island for time immemorial. They are both part of the natural world and - at the same time - something beyond nature. Native Islanders, known as the Dahan, have learned how to co-exist with the spirits, but with a healthy dose of fear and reverence. However, now, the island has been &quot;discovered&quot; by invaders from a far-off land. These would-be colonists are taking over the land and upsetting the natural balance, destroying the presence of Spirits as they go. As Spirits, you must grow in power and work together to drive the invaders from your island... before it's too late!</p>",

Native Islanders, known as the Dahan, have learned how to co-exist with the spirits, but with a healthy dose of fear and reverence. However, now, the island has been \"discovered\" by invaders from a far-off land. These would-be colonists are taking over the land and upsetting the natural balance, destroying the presence of Spirits as they go. As Spirits, you must grow in power and work together to drive the invaders from your island... before it's too late! "

      "faq": "<p><strong>How do you eplain this game?</strong></p>\n<p>This is a word-guessing game where two opposing teams compete to get in contact with all of their secret agents first by discovering their codenames. Each team has an assigned Spymaster who possesses a key card that reveals the location of all of the team's agents, and they must give a one word clue to help the team discover their agents. Take a risk by offering a clue that will point to as many of the secret agents, but you may unintentionally alert the assassin instead. (Here are the <a href=\"https://czechgames.com/files/rules/codenames-rules-en.pdf\">official rules in PDF</a>.)</p>\n<p><strong>What is the best version to buy?</strong></p>\n<p>The soaring popularity of Codenames spawned more than 11 different versions to choose from including Marvel, Harry Potter, Disney, and more. If you're looking for the best version that will strike a chord with the most diverse set of crowds, start with the original Codenames. If you're looking for a solid 2-player cooperative experience, get <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/9e0nNBNyOU/codenames-duet\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: '9e0nNBNyOU', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Codenames: Duet</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>How can I play online with my friends?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://codenames.game/\">Codenames Online</a> is the official free-to-play digital adaptation of the board game. Create a room, send the invite link, and catch up with friends and families by playing a fun board game alongside your usual Zoom meetings.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you play with 2 players?</strong></p>\n<p>The official rules include a 2-player variant to allow cooperative play against a simulated opponent. You can try this out even with a large group if they're not in the mood for competitive play. If you're looking for a strictly 2-player game, then I'd recommend <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/9e0nNBNyOU/codenames-duet\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: '9e0nNBNyOU', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Codenames: Duet</a>, which was specifically designed for a low player count.</p>\n<p><strong>How many guesses do you get every turn?</strong></p>\n<p>In every turn, the spymaster will say a one-word clue and a number, which tells the team how many codenames are associated with the clue. The team is allowed as many guesses as that number plus one extra. Taking this risk is a big part of the fun!</p>",

Through strategic trading and building, clever planning, and careful thought, players add settlements and castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, farm livestock, and more in this classic Stefan Feld Eurogame.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow to Play: 1. Players take turns rolling two dice and choosing to move goods tiles from the game board to their player boards; from their player boards onto corresponding numbered and colored regions of their playing fields; to deliver goods in exchange for silverlings; or to take worker tiles. 2. Play continues, with players completing additional actions and noting victory points for each tile placed. 3.

      "description": "<p>As a wealthy Renaissance merchant, acquire mines and transportation, hire artisans and woo the nobility. Create the most fantastic jewelry to become the best-known merchant of them all! Acquire precious stones to trade them for development cards. Use development cards to acquire more gem stones. Use your gems and gold to create the most fantastic jewelry, and appeal to the nobles to gain the prestige you need to win.<br /><br />Splendor is a fast-paced and addictive game of chip-collecting and card development. Players are merchants of the Renaissance trying to buy gem mines, means of transportation, shops; all in order to acquire the most prestige points. If you're wealthy enough, you might even receive a visit from a noble at some point, which of course will further increase your prestige.<br /><br />On your turn, you may (1) collect chips (gems), or (2) buy and build a card, or (3) reserve one card. If you collect chips, you take either three different kinds of chips or two chips of the same kind. If you buy a card, you pay its price in chips and add it to your playing area. To reserve a card, you place it in front of you face down for later building; this costs you a round, but you also get gold in the form of a joker chip, which you can use as any gem.<br /><br />All of the cards you buy increase your wealth as they give you a permanent gem bonus for later buys; some of the cards also give you prestige points. In order to win the game, you must reach 15 prestige points before your opponents do.</p>",

      "description_preview": " As a wealthy Renaissance merchant, acquire mines and transportation, hire artisans and woo the nobility. Create the most fantastic jewelry to become the best-known merchant of them all! Acquire precious stones to trade them for development cards. Use development cards to acquire more gem stones. Use your gems and gold to create the most fantastic jewelry, and appeal to the nobles to gain the prestige you need to win.  Splendor is a fast-paced and addictive game of chip-collecting and card development. Players are merchants of the Renaissance trying to buy gem mines, means of transportation, shops; all in order to acquire the most prestige points. If you're wealthy enough, you might even receive a visit from a noble at some point, which of course will further increase your prestige.  On your turn, you may (1) collect chips (gems), or (2) buy and build a card, or (3) reserve one card. If you collect chips, you take either three different kinds of chips or two chips of the same kind. If you buy a card, you pay its price in chips and add it to your playing area. To reserve a card, you place it in front of you face down for later building; this costs you a round, but you also get gold in the form of a joker chip, which you can use as any gem.  All of the cards you buy increase your wealth as they give you a permanent gem bonus for later buys; some of the cards also give you prestige points. In order to win the game, you must reach 15 prestige points before your opponents do. "

      "description": "<p>The world is on the brink of disaster. In Pandemic Legacy, your disease-fighting team must keep four deadly diseases at bay for a whole year. Each month will bring new surprises, and your actions in each game will have repercussions on the next. Will you let cities fall to the diseases? Will your team be enough to keep the viruses at bay for a whole year? Craft your own unique Pandemic experience with Pandemic Legacy.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pandemic Legacy</strong> is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic <em><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic\">Pandemic</a></em>, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.</p>\r\n<p>During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.</p>\r\n<p>After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.</p>\r\n<p>Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.</p>\r\n<p>During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.</p>",

      "description_preview": " The world is on the brink of disaster. In Pandemic Legacy, your disease-fighting team must keep four deadly diseases at bay for a whole year. Each month will bring new surprises, and your actions in each game will have repercussions on the next. Will you let cities fall to the diseases? Will your team be enough to keep the viruses at bay for a whole year? Craft your own unique Pandemic experience with Pandemic Legacy. \r\n  Pandemic Legacy  is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic   Pandemic  , in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand. \r\n During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions. \r\n After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to. \r\n Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards. \r\n During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play. "

      "description": "<p><strong>Ticket to Ride</strong> is a cross-country train adventure game. Players collect train cards that enable them to claim railway routes connecting cities throughout North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who can fulfill their Destination Tickets by connecting two distant cities, and to the player who builds the longest continuous railway. So climb aboard for some railroading fun and adventure. You've got a Ticket to Ride!<br /><br />October 2, 1900 -- it's 28 years to the day that noted London eccentric, Phileas Fogg accepted and then won a 20,000 bet that he could travel Around the World in 80 Days. Now at the dawn of the century some old friends have gathered to celebrate Fogg's impetuous and lucrative gamble -- and to propose a new wager of their own. The stakes: $1 million in a winner-takes-all competition. The objective: to see the most cities in North America -- in just 7 days. <br /><br />-Spiel Des Jahres 2004(German game of the year)<br />-As d'Or Cannes 2004 (French game of the year)<br />-Game of the year 2004 - Japan<br />-Game of the year 2004 - Sweden<br />-Game of the year 2004 - Finland<br />-Diana Jones Excellence in Gaming Award 2004<br />-Origins Award Winner - Best Board Game 2005<br />-Game of the year 2004 - Spain<br />-Parent's Choice Foundation Silver Medal 2004</p>",

Players collect train cards that enable them to claim railway routes connecting cities throughout North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who can fulfill their Destination Tickets by connecting two distant cities, and to the player who builds the longest continuous railway. So climb aboard for some railroading fun and adventure. You've got a Ticket to Ride!  October 2, 1900 -- it's 28 years to the day that noted London eccentric, Phileas Fogg accepted and then won a 20,000 bet that he could travel Around the World in 80 Days. Now at the dawn of the century some old friends have gathered to celebrate Fogg's impetuous and lucrative gamble -- and to propose a new wager of their own. The stakes: $1 million in a winner-takes-all competition. The objective: to see the most cities in North America -- in just 7 days.   -Spiel Des Jahres 2004(German game of the year) -As d'Or Cannes 2004 (French game of the year) -Game of the year 2004 - Japan -Game of the year 2004 - Sweden -Game of the year 2004 - Finland -Diana Jones Excellence in Gaming Award 2004 -Origins Award Winner - Best Board Game 2005 -Game of the year 2004 - Spain -Parent's Choice Foundation Silver Medal 2004 "

      "description": "<p><em><strong>Brass: Birmingham</strong></em> is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace's 2007 masterpiece, <em>Brass</em>. <em>Birmingham</em> tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.</p>\r\n<p>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.</p>\r\n<p>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):</p>\r\n<p>1) <strong>Build</strong> - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br />2) <strong>Network</strong> - Add a rail/canal link, expanding your network.<br />3) <strong>Develop</strong> - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br />4) <strong>Sell</strong> - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br />5) <strong>Loan</strong> - Take a £30 loan and reduce your income.</p>\r\n<p><em>Brass: Birmingham</em> also features a new sixth action:</p>\r\n<p>6) <strong>Scout</strong> - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original <em>Brass</em>.)</p>\r\n<p>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.</p>\r\n<p><em>Birmingham</em> features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.</p>\r\n<p>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original <em>Brass</em> as well as in <em>Brass: Birmingham</em>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>New &quot;Sell&quot; system</strong></p>\r\n<p>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.</p>\r\n<p><em>Birmingham</em> features three all-new industry types:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Brewery</strong> - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Manufactured goods</strong> - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pottery</strong> - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Increased Coal and Iron Market size</strong> - The price of coal and iron can now go up to £8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.</p>\r\n<p><em>Brass: Birmingham</em> is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.</p>",

      "description_preview": "   Brass: Birmingham   is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace's 2007 masterpiece,  Brass .  Birmingham  tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870. \r\n As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands. \r\n Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game): \r\n 1)  Build  - Pay required resources and place an industry tile. 2)  Network  - Add a rail/canal link, expanding your network. 3)  Develop  - Increase the VP value of an industry. 4)  Sell  - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery. 5)  Loan  - Take a £30 loan and reduce your income. \r\n  Brass: Birmingham  also features a new sixth action: \r\n 6)  Scout  - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original  Brass .) \r\n The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles. \r\n  Birmingham  features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement. \r\n Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original  Brass  as well as in  Brass: Birmingham . \r\n  New \"Sell\" system  \r\n Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also \"grease the wheels of industry\" by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer. \r\n  Birmingham  features three all-new industry types: \r\n  Brewery  - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods. \r\n  Manufactured goods  - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton. \r\n  Pottery  - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan. \r\n  Increased Coal and Iron Market size  - The price of coal and iron can now go up to £8 per cube, and it's not uncommon. \r\n  Brass: Birmingham  is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor. "

      "description": "<p>The women and men of your expedition build the first two settlements. Fortunately, the land is rich in natural resources. You build roads and new settlements that eventually become cities. Will you succeed in gaining supremacy on Catan? Barter trade dominates the scene. Some resources you have in abundance, other resources are scarce. Ore for wool, brick for lumber - you trade according to what is needed for your current building projects. Proceed strategically! If you found your settlements in the right places and skillfully trade your resources, then the odds will be in your favor. But your opponents are smart too.</p>\r\n<p>To begin the game, we build the game board using hexagonal terrain tiles. Catan is born - a beautiful island with mountains, pastures, hills, fields, and forests, surrounded by the sea.</p>\r\n<p>Each of us places two small houses on spaces where three terrain hexes meet. They are our starting settlements.</p>\r\n<p>And so it begins. I roll two dice. An “11”! Each terrain hex is marked with a die roll number. Each player who owns a settlement adjacent to a terrain hex marked with the number rolled receives a resource produced by this hex. Hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and pastures produce wool.</p>\r\n<p>We use these resources to expand across Catan: we build roads and new settlements, or we upgrade our existing settlements to cities. For example, a road costs 1 brick and 1 lumber. If we do not have the necessary resources, we can acquire them by trading with our opponents.</p>\r\n<p>Each settlement is worth 1 victory point and each city is worth 2 victory points. If you expand cleverly, you may be the first player to reach 10 victory points and thus win the game!</p>",

      "description_preview": " The women and men of your expedition build the first two settlements. Fortunately, the land is rich in natural resources. You build roads and new settlements that eventually become cities. Will you succeed in gaining supremacy on Catan? Barter trade dominates the scene. Some resources you have in abundance, other resources are scarce. Ore for wool, brick for lumber - you trade according to what is needed for your current building projects. Proceed strategically! If you found your settlements in the right places and skillfully trade your resources, then the odds will be in your favor. But your opponents are smart too. \r\n To begin the game, we build the game board using hexagonal terrain tiles. Catan is born - a beautiful island with mountains, pastures, hills, fields, and forests, surrounded by the sea. \r\n Each of us places two small houses on spaces where three terrain hexes meet. They are our starting settlements. \r\n And so it begins. I roll two dice. An “11”! Each terrain hex is marked with a die roll number. Each player who owns a settlement adjacent to a terrain hex marked with the number rolled receives a resource produced by this hex. Hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and pastures produce wool. \r\n We use these resources to expand across Catan: we build roads and new settlements, or we upgrade our existing settlements to cities. For example, a road costs 1 brick and 1 lumber. If we do not have the necessary resources, we can acquire them by trading with our opponents. \r\n Each settlement is worth 1 victory point and each city is worth 2 victory points. If you expand cleverly, you may be the first player to reach 10 victory points and thus win the game! "

      "description": "<p>Patchwork is a form of needlework that involves sewing together pieces of fabric into a larger design. In the past, it was a way to make use of leftover pieces of cloth to create clothing and quilts. Today, patchwork is a form of art, in which the designers use precious fabrics to create beautiful textiles. The use of uneven pieces of fabric in particular can result in real masterpieces and is therefore being practiced by a large number of textile artists.<br /><br />To create a beautiful quilt, however, requires effort and time, but the available patches just do not want to fit together. So choose your patches carefully and keep a healthy supply of buttons to not only finish your quilt, but to make it better and more beautiful than your opponent's.</p>",

In the past, it was a way to make use of leftover pieces of cloth to create clothing and quilts. Today, patchwork is a form of art, in which the designers use precious fabrics to create beautiful textiles. The use of uneven pieces of fabric in particular can result in real masterpieces and is therefore being practiced by a large number of textile artists.  To create a beautiful quilt, however, requires effort and time, but the available patches just do not want to fit together. So choose your patches carefully and keep a healthy supply of buttons to not only finish your quilt, but to make it better and more beautiful than your opponent's. "

      "description": "<p>In Race for the Galaxy from Rio Grande Games, players build galactic civilizations using game cards that represent worlds or technical and social developments. Each round consists of one or more of five possible phases. In each round, each player secretly and simultaneously chooses one of seven different action cards and then reveals it. Only the selected phases occur. For these phases, every player performs the phasea€s action, while the selecting player(s) also get a bonus for that phase. For example, if at least one player chooses the Develop action, then the Develop phase will occur, otherwise it is skipped. In it, each player may simultaneously select a development from his hand of cards to build. After revealing the cards, each player adds his development to his tableau of cards on the table and then discards cards from his hand equal to its cost. Each player who chose Develop discards one card fewer as his bonus. Explore allows a player to draw cards and select which of them to add to his hand. Settle allows a player to place a world in his tableau. Some worlds produce goods, represented by face down cards, when Produce is selected. These goods can be discarded for victory points or sold to add cards to the player's hand by selecting Consume. With cards, players can settle new worlds and build more developments, gaining both victory points and card powers that provide advantages in certain phases. The player who best manages his cards, phase and bonus selections, and card powers to build the greatest space empire, wins. The winner is the player with the most victory points.</p>",

      "description_preview": " In Race for the Galaxy from Rio Grande Games, players build galactic civilizations using game cards that represent worlds or technical and social developments. Each round consists of one or more of five possible phases. In each round, each player secretly and simultaneously chooses one of seven different action cards and then reveals it. Only the selected phases occur. For these phases, every player performs the phasea€s action, while the selecting player(s) also get a bonus for that phase. For example, if at least one player chooses the Develop action, then the Develop phase will occur, otherwise it is skipped. In it, each player may simultaneously select a development from his hand of cards to build. After revealing the cards, each player adds his development to his tableau of cards on the table and then discards cards from his hand equal to its cost. Each player who chose Develop discards one card fewer as his bonus. Explore allows a player to draw cards and select which of them to add to his hand. Settle allows a player to place a world in his tableau. Some worlds produce goods, represented by face down cards, when Produce is selected. These goods can be discarded for victory points or sold to add cards to the player's hand by selecting Consume. With cards, players can settle new worlds and build more developments, gaining both victory points and card powers that provide advantages in certain phases. The player who best manages his cards, phase and bonus selections, and card powers to build the greatest space empire, wins. The winner is the player with the most victory points. "

      "description": "<div>\r\n<p>Welcome to the world of <em><strong>Santorini</strong></em>, a fantastic reimagining of the classic abstract game from 2004. Players are given a sandbox in which to play as gods, moving their workers around the board to build up a beautiful, multi-tiered city. Do you have what it takes to outsmart your opponents? Find out, in <em>Santorini</em>!</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p><em><strong>Santorini</strong></em> is a re-imagining of the purely abstract 2004 edition. Since its original inception over 30 years ago, Santorini has been continually developed, enhanced and refined by designer Gordon Hamilton.</p>\r\n<p>Santorini is an accessible strategy game, simple enough for an elementary school classroom while aiming to provide gameplay depth and content for hardcore gamers to explore, The rules are simple. Each turn consists of 2 steps:</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Move</strong> - move one of your builders into a neighboring space. You may move your Builder Pawn on the same level, step-up one level, or step down any number of levels.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Build</strong> - Then construct a building level adjacent to the builder you moved. When building on top of the third level, place a dome instead, removing that space from play.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Winning the game</strong> - If either of your builders reaches the third level, you win.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Variable player powers</strong> - Santorini features variable player powers layered over an otherwise abstract game, with 40 thematic god and hero powers that fundamentally change the way the game is played.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><br /><br />Turns in <em>Santorini</em> are made up of two simple step: Move and Build. Move around the board and build a building in a spot adjacent to one of your workers. The first player to move their worker from a second level building to a third level building wins the game! Though, there are a few things that add a wrinkle to the basic formula.<br /><br />Invoke the Power of the gods!<br />Each player will have access to a god power which lets them do things a little differently than normal. Be it changing the rules for how you can build or move, changing how you interact with other players, or providing you with an alternate victory condition, the 30 different god powers are sure to make every game of <em>Santorini</em> different and exciting!</p>\r\n</div>",

      "description_preview": " \r\n Welcome to the world of   Santorini  , a fantastic reimagining of the classic abstract game from 2004. Players are given a sandbox in which to play as gods, moving their workers around the board to build up a beautiful, multi-tiered city. Do you have what it takes to outsmart your opponents? Find out, in  Santorini ! \r\n \r\n \r\n   Santorini   is a re-imagining of the purely abstract 2004 edition. Since its original inception over 30 years ago, Santorini has been continually developed, enhanced and refined by designer Gordon Hamilton. \r\n Santorini is an accessible strategy game, simple enough for an elementary school classroom while aiming to provide gameplay depth and content for hardcore gamers to explore, The rules are simple. Each turn consists of 2 steps: \r\n  1. Move  - move one of your builders into a neighboring space. You may move your Builder Pawn on the same level, step-up one level, or step down any number of levels. \r\n  2. Build  - Then construct a building level adjacent to the builder you moved. When building on top of the third level, place a dome instead, removing that space from play. \r\n  Winning the game  - If either of your builders reaches the third level, you win. \r\n  Variable player powers  - Santorini features variable player powers layered over an otherwise abstract game, with 40 thematic god and hero powers that fundamentally change the way the game is played. \r\n \r\n \r\n   Turns in  Santorini  are made up of two simple step: Move and Build. Move around the board and build a building in a spot adjacent to one of your workers. The first player to move their worker from a second level building to a third level building wins the game! Though, there are a few things that add a wrinkle to the basic formula.  Invoke the Power of the gods! Each player will have access to a god power which lets them do things a little differently than normal. Be it changing the rules for how you can build or move, changing how you interact with other players, or providing you with an alternate victory condition, the 30 different god powers are sure to make every game of  Santorini  different and exciting! \r\n "
