# Match-Point

## Overview: 

Have a hard time getting friends to commit to a time for game night? Have an extensive board game collection and no one to play with? MatchPoint is for you! MatchPoint is an app that helps you put together game nights with board game enthusiasts near you. It’s as easy as creating a profile with your availability to play and searching for games that interest you. Once you pick one, simply add it to your list and, once enough people have shown interest and have the same availability, a board game session can be scheduled to play that game at that time.  

If you have games you want to play with others, you can also build your own board game library based on games you own. Then, other people can view and show interest in scheduling a game night around one of your games, too.

## Features:
